<a:If notEqualNull="$table.currentColumn.contentElement">\
    <!--- NOTE: $parent.this is equalvalent to $parent.parent since $parent is an AWSubcomponent and since AWSubcomponent's always forward messages to them to their parent.  If we used $parent.parent (which is what we really want), we would effectively have $parent.parent.parent.  At some point I will fix AWSubcomponets to not incur a component in the chain, so this will break at that time (when we can probably completely remove the 'context' binding).  Another point to realize is that someday I will be using the new awcomponentReference feature of AWSwitchComponent and we'll eliminate these Control/Renderer distinctions and that will present a different issue as well. --->\
