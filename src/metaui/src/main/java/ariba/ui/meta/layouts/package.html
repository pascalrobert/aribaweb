Set of meta-data aware UI components for UI generation.
<p/>
All AW/Widgets components can be incorporated in MetaUI generated interfaces, usually
without any wrapping by using the {@link ariba.ui.meta.core.MetaIncludeComponent m:IncludeComponent} tag.
However, some require some meta-data-aware wrapper components, and those are provided here.
