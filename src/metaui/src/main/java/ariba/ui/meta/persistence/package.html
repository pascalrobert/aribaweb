Abstractions for binding meta UI into an ORM persistence framework.
MetaUI naturally excels at generating "out of the box" UIs for ORM-backed
packages of business object classes.  The meta.persistence package defines
the abstractions necessary to interface meta UI with a variety of such
persistence packages (such as JPA-based frameworks like Hibernate or Toplink).
Additional packages (such as ariba.ui.meta.jpa) implement these abstractions
to interface to a particular implemenation.
